## Getting Started

To get started with the Remix Tutorial, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js version `>=20.0.0` installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AndyTiTi/remix-tutorial.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd remix-tutorial
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start your app in development mode, which will rebuild assets on file changes:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

Before deploying, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to. If you're familiar with deploying Node.js applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready. Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`, which includes:

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

For more detailed information and guidance, refer to the [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs).
